# Clicker_Simulator

Hey there, welcome to "Coding Simulator"! Get ready for a gaming adventure that mixes coding and fun like never before. Imagine an idle game, like Cookie Clicker, but instead of mindless clicks, you make money by writing code.

The deal is simple: the better you code, the more cash you make. Start small, typing away to earn some virtual bucks. But here's the kicker: as you get better at different programming languages, you'll see your bank account grow bigger and bigger.

Now, here’s where the real fun begins. With all that dough you've earned, you can dive into creating coding projects. And guess what? These projects keep making money for you even when you’re not playing. The catch? The more you learn and master new languages, the cooler and more profitable these projects become!

But wait, there’s more! You can pimp out your projects with awesome upgrades. Spend your hard-earned cash to supercharge these projects and watch your income soar.

"Coding Simulator" is where coding smarts meet gaming thrills. So, whether you're a coding whiz or just love a good game, jump in! It's time to level up your coding game and rake in the digital dough!
